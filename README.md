# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a TOP's project to create a simple rock paper scissors game. Currently only stays on console (not the game one).

## Notes
This took FOREVER to finish but it was mostly from feeling overwhelmed by the tasks to do and shame because truthfully, this wasn't my first Rock Paper Scissors project I had done on TOP. Rereading about forgetting stuff and all that by one of the founder made me less freaked out about this.

Hope the next time I come across this situation, it wouldn't need 2 months to snap myself out of the slump though...

## Revisiting update
Finally did the revisiting lesson. Added simple UI. Need some work on the fonts but for the time being, this will do.
